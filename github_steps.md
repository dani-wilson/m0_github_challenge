# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

1. Create the new repository on github and copy the SSH link for that repository
2. In Terminal, do git remote add origin <link>
3. git branch -M main
4. git push -u origin main
5. Refresh the repository in github to see that it was done properly
